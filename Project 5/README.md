# Project #5 â€“ Texture Mapping

## Description of what I did do get the display I got:

I saw the automation tips at the bottom of the project description, so I decided that I wanted to try and
implement them. After adding all the global variables and structures, I first figured out how to create all
the display lists with automation. I had to make the first sphere manually, but then the rest were done in a
for loop. I found out I could use this automation for everything, so I automated binding the textures,
scaling and displaying the planets, and setting the keyboard keys. 

I really liked this approach, as once I
got one thing working, they all were working. I then made a basic function to make the light loop around
the planets, and I toggled between all the modes using a few Booleans.
