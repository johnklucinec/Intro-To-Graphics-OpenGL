# Project 1 - Draw Something Cool in 3D!

## Description of what I did do get the display I got:

I wanted to challenge myself by only using triangle strips and I wanted to make a ninja star /
shuriken. 

I knew the blade would be the hardest thing to do, so that is what I started on.
First, I started to make the V part of the blade, but I could not figure out how to make the
blade edge and connect it to the main shape. Basically, I made the top of the blade and the
edges, and then transformed them so they looked connected. If I were to redo this, I would
have just made them one shape. 

For the blade shaft, I was able to get that to be one piece,
but the center was just two toruses (tori?). I used two colors for the shaft and center, and
then four different shades of grey for the metal. I used four shades of grey to make the
bottom look like it had a shadow to help with depth. And then I made it all into a sphere.
