# Project #6 – Shaders

## Description of what I did do get the display I got:

After importing all the files, I first worked on getting the fragment shader to light the salmon correctly.
That was not too difficult, as the starter code was easy to follow. Without any animation, I started getting
the fish to change shape in the vertex shader. After making it bend in the wrong direction first (making it
move like a dolphin), I eventually got the salmon to wiggle from side to side. I then went into my display
function, passing in variables for the amplitude, speed, frequency, and time. 

To change between the
stages, I made a few arrays for each variable and set 5 values of my choosing. I then put a key bind for
each variable that I could toggle with the a, s, and f keys. 

Getting the fragment shader to highlight the
fish’s eyes was the most difficult, but once I got the first equation down, I could do the same for the
second eye.
