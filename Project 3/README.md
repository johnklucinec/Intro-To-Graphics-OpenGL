# Project #3 â€“ Lighting

## Description of what I did do get the display I got:

For this project, I started by adding all the figures and arranging them so they would be in a
circle. Then, I enabled lighting (and disabled at the end) and used the point light function to
make some light appear. I then created a small sphere with lighting disabled and made it
share the position and color of the light. 

I then had to find a way to animate the light, so
after much trial and error, I decided to animate a Triquetra, so it would basically loop
around each object. I then started playing around with the anvil lighting to try and make it
shiny. I used black because I thought it looked the best. I then did the same with the yellow
figure, making it matte/dull. For the Lego figure, I just used the provided material function.

Using the provided functions and enum, I then implemented the spotlight and light colors.
